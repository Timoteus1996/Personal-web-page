        <p> Portuguese is a Romance language, meaning it evolved from Latin, just like Spanish, French, Italian, and Romanian. Like other Romance languages, is characterized by its grammatical complexity, including noun gender (masculine and feminine), verb conjugations, and noun-adjective agreement.   There are several Portuguese dialects spoken around the world, with Brazilian Portuguese being the most widely spoken and recognized. European Portuguese, spoken in Portugal, has its own distinct characteristics in terms of pronunciation, vocabulary, and even grammar, when compared to Brazilian Portuguese. </p>

                    <h3>Vilakazi Street, Orlando West</h3>
                    
                    <div class="column" >
                    
                    <p>Vilakazi Street boasts a unique claim to fame - it's the only street in the world to have housed two Nobel Peace Prize winners! Nelson Mandela. Vilakazi Street stands as a symbol of Soweto's resilience during the apartheid era. Despite facing hardships and oppression, the township fostered the rise of influential figures who played a pivotal role in South Africa's struggle for equality.</p>

                   <h3>Soweto Towers</h3>
                    <div class="column">
                    
                    <p class="mid"> Originally built in the 1950s as cooling towers for a power station, they served as a symbol of the apartheid regime's control over Soweto.  However, after the power station closed, the towers were transformed. The mural on the towers isn't just any artwork. It features prominent figures from South African history like Nelson Mandela, alongside images of everyday people and township life.</p>

                    <div class="column">
                    
                    <p>Mandela lived in this modest house from 1946 to 1962, a period that coincided with the heart of the anti-apartheid movement. Stepping into the house allows visitors to connect with Mandela on a personal level.  Original furnishings, photographs, and memorabilia paint a picture of his life before his imprisonment. The modest nature of the house stands in contrast to Mandela's extraordinary achievements.</p>
